    <h1>Angels to Fly</h1>

    <div class="verse">
        <div class="section-title">[Verse 1]</div>
        <p>White lips, pale face<br>
        Breathin' in the snowflakes<br>
        Burnt lungs, sour taste<br>
        Light's gone, days end<br>
        Struggling to pay rent<br>
        Long nights, strange men</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pre-chorus">
        <div class="section-title">[Pre-Chorus]</div>
        <p>And they say<br>
        She's in the Class A Team<br>
        Stuck in her daydream<br>
        Been this way since eighteen<br>
        But lately, her face seems<br>
        Slowly sinking, wasting<br>
        Crumbling like pastries<br>
        And they scream<br>
        The worst things in life come free to us</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chorus">
        <div class="section-title">[Chorus]</div>
        <p>'Cause we're just under the upper hand<br>
        And go mad for a couple grams<br>
        And she don't wanna go outside tonight<br>
        And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland<br>
        Or sells love to another man<br>
        It's too cold outside<br>
        For angels to fly<br>
        Angels to fly</p>
    </div>

    <div class="verse">
        <div class="section-title">[Verse 2]</div>
        <p>Ripped gloves, raincoat<br>
        Tried to swim and stay afloat<br>
        Dry house, wet clothes<br>
        Loose change, banknotes<br>
        Weary-eyed, dry throat<br>
        Call girl, no phone</p>
    </div>

        <p>An angel will die<br>
        Covered in white<br>
        Closed eye and hopin' for a better life<br>
        This time, we'll fade out tonight<br>
        Straight down the line</p>
